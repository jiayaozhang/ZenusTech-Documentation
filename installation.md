# End-user Installation

## Download binary release

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/zenustech/zeno/releases/), and click Assets -> download `zeno-linux-20xx.x.x.tar.gz`.
Then, extract this archive, and simply run `./launcher` (`launcher.exe` for Windows), then the node editor window will shows up if everything is working well.

## How to play

There are some example graphs in the `graphs/` folder, you may open them in the editor and have fun!
Hint: To run an animation for 100 frames, change the `1` on the top-left of node editor to `100`, then click `Run`.
Also MMB to drag in the node editor, LMB click on sockets to create connections. MMB drag in the viewport to orbit camera, Shift+MMB to pan camera.
More details are available in [our official tutorial](https://zenustech.com/tutorial).
